# Default Endpoints 

HiveApi comes shipped with many useful API endpoints to help speeding up the development process. To see all the 
endpoints in a beautiful documentation run the `php artisan apidocjs:generate` command, after installing the apidocjs 
tool. 

See the [API Docs Generator](./../features/api-docs-generator.html) page for more details.
